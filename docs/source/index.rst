PySP2 documentation
===================

PySP2 is a python package for reading and processing Single Particle Soot
Photometer (SP2) datasets. It is capable of reading the .sp2b files that the
IGOR-based software can read. In addition, it can process particle size
distributions with custom filtering criteria in order to remove artifacts in
data.
